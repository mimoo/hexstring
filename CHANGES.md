## 0.2.1 (2020-05-18)

Much more efficient implementations of encode and decode

## 0.2.0 (2020-05-14)

The decode API cannot panic anymore!

## 0.1.2 (2020-05-14)

Let's see if this works.
## 0.1.1 (2020-05-14)

Error releasing 0.1, trying again.

## 0.1 (2020-05-14)

First version, only supports encode and decode, and decode can panic if given invalid characters.
